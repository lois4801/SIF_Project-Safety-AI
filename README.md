- To use API or hyperlinks to connect different platforms used from data gathering, data cleaning until data presentation

## A. Introduction

SIF stands for Serious Injury and Fatality. SIF prevention methods are all about stopping these kinds of accidents from happening in the workplace.
There are a number of ways to achieve SIF prevention, and effective strategies typically involve a combination of approaches. 

## B. Key areas to focus on:

- Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment:
-- Proactive identification of high-energy hazards is crucial. This involves inspecting workplaces, reviewing past incidents, and understanding the tasks performed by workers. Once hazards are identified, steps can be taken to assess and mitigate the risks.

- Implementing Effective Safety Controls: 
-- There are two main types of controls: eliminating hazards altogether and implementing safeguards to minimize harm if an accident occurs. Examples include using guardrails when working at heights, ensuring proper ventilation when working with chemicals, and requiring workers to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

- Building a Strong Safety Culture:
-- This goes beyond just having rules in place. It's about creating an environment where everyone feels empowered to identify and report safety hazards, and where following safety procedures is the norm. This can be achieved through training, leadership commitment, and open communication.

- Data Analysis and Improvement:
-- Safety programs should be data-driven. By collecting and analyzing information on near misses and past incidents, organizations can identify trends and areas where they need to focus their SIF prevention efforts.

## C. Creating, Designing, Generating Database and Dataset
### 1. DATA Structure
### a. Incident ID
- Unique identifier for each incident

### b. DAte of Incident
- Data when the incident occured

### c. Location
- Specific location where the incident took place (eg. Substation, power plant, field site)

### d. Type of Incident
- Categorization of the incident (eg. Electrical shock, fall from height, equipment failure)

### e. Severity 
- Classification of the incident severity (serious, injury , fatality)

### f. Description of Incident
- Detailed description of what happened.

### g. Cause
- Root cause of the incident (e.g., human error, equipment malfunction, environmental factors).

### h. Victim Details
- Information about the victim(s) involved (e.g., job title, years of experience, age).

### i. Safety Equipment Used
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) used at the time of the incident (e.g., gloves, helmets, harness).

### j. Witnesses
- Names or number of witnesses to the incident.

### k. Investigation Findings
- Summary of findings from the incident investigation.

### l. Corrective Actions Taken
- Actions implemented to prevent recurrence of similar incidents.

### m. Reporting Agency
- The agency or authority to which the incident was reported (e.g., CCOHS , OSHA, local regulatory body).

### o. Legal Consequences
- Any legal actions or fines resulting from the incident.
